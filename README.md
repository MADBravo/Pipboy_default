# Pipboy_default
A website in the theme of a pipboy from the game series: Fallout.

This is a follow-along project from Joseph Delgadillo and Nick Germaine's "Complete Front-End Development Course" from Udemy.
However, due to being a couple years old Bootstrap has changed from version 4.0 > 5.0 and extentions such as Teather either 
break the coding or are unusable with the current version of bootstrap. (5.0)

Nonetheless, I have figured how to use Mr.Delgadillo and Mr.Germaine's instructions to contruct a 2021 version of a Pipboy website
using Bootstrap 5.0, css3, and HTML5.

I did use the current bootstrap 5.0 coding to build the dropdown button and navigation and rebuilt it to the instructer's previous instructions. 
I thank bootstrap for adding updated coding to help me build my own website.

So then~
Download the Pipboy_default folder. Inside index.html, js/pipboy.app.js, css/pipboy.app.css, --
Either drag the index.html or "open with" 'your browser' to open up the Pipboy webpage.
